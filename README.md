QAutomate
===

Automate certain tasks when developing in Quasar.

Currently supports:

1. Automatically look for QComponents, Directives and Plugins used within your project and adding them to your Quasar.conf.js file.

# Install
```bash
quasar ext add qautomate
```
Quasar CLI will retrieve it from NPM and install the extension.

## Prompts

(yet to be implemented):

1. AutoFix - Whether or not the AE should auto add to the Quasar conf or just notify in console.

# Uninstall
```bash
quasar ext remove qautomate
```

# Roadmap
* CLI command to check the source for any *unused* components and list / remove from quasar.conf.js file.
